"""
This is an example of how SimpleCV can be used so easily to do anything.
I am controlling volume and changing songs in banshee media player by
detecting optical flow.
Banshee has a bug, so a banshee window should be opened before running
this program.
I am using multiprocessing and multithreading to control banshee media
player.

Requirements:
SimpleCV, and its dependencies
alsaaudio library to control volume
Banshee Media Player

Tested on Ubuntu 11.10
